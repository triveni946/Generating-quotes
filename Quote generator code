            "Life is an awful, ugly place to not have a best friend.",
            "Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art.... It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.",
            "The most valuable gift you can receive is an honest friend.",
            "Friendship is really the finest balm for the pangs of disappointed love.",
            "Friendship gives us the strength to turn from lambs into lions.",
            "A friend who is far away is sometimes much nearer than one who is at hand",
            "Because everything of value that we will know in this life comes from our relationships with those around us. Because there is nothing material that measures against the intangibles of love and friendship.",
            "At times, we are the bridge that allows another to re-enter the world after a loss. Don't mistake it for more or its beauty may be lost.",
